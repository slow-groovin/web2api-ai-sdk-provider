**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is important to us. This tool does **not** collect, store, or use any personal information from users.

We do not track your activity, store any data you input, or share any information with third parties. All interactions occur locally and are not logged or transmitted by us.

However, please be aware that this tool may rely on upstream services or infrastructure (such as hosting providers, APIs, or third-party platforms). We do **not** control these services and **cannot guarantee** their privacy practices or behavior. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of any third-party services that may be involved indirectly.

By using this tool, you acknowledge and accept that while we do our best to protect your privacy, we are not responsible for the actions of external services.
